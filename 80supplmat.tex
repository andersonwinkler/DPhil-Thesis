The multiplicity of scenarios evaluated in Chapters~\ref{sec:accel} and \ref{sec:cortex} resulted in the construction of more than 40 thousand plots and maps, which do not fit the thesis format; a selection of a few results would unduly overemphasise certain aspects at the expense of others. Instead, we organised these plots in a browsable set of pages, and packaged them into a single, 9.7~\textsc{gb} file that can be downloaded and browsed locally. This file is deposited for long term preservation and public access at the Research Archive of the Bodleian Libraries (\textsc{ora}-Data), and it constitutes the Supplementary Material that accompanies this thesis, accessible under the Digital Object Identifier (\textsc{doi}): \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.9999/xyz}{10.9999/xyz}.\footnote{{\emph{\color{orange}\textsc{note for the assessors}: The \textsc{doi} will be produced should the thesis be approved.}}} The results shown in the thesis make ample reference to this material, and its inspection is encouraged. Mirrored copies that does not require download of a large file, though not guaranteed for long term preservation, can be found at:
