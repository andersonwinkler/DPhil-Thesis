The multiplicity of scenarios evaluated in Chapters \ref{sec:ptree}, \ref{sec:accel} and \ref{sec:cortex} resulted in the construction of more than 52 thousand plots and maps, which do not fit the thesis format. Although the most interesting and relevant results are already shown in the main text, a further selection of a few results would unduly overemphasise certain aspects at the expense of others. Instead, to facilitate presentation, these plots were organised in a browsable set of pages and packaged them into a single, 9.8~\textsc{gb} file that can be downloaded and browsed locally. This file is deposited for long term preservation and public access at the Research Archive of the Bodleian Libraries (\textsc{ora}-Data), and it constitutes the Appendix that accompanies this thesis, and is accessible under its own Digital Object Identifier (\textsc{doi}): \href{https://doi.org/10.5287/bodleian:AePBKpxV8}{\textbf{10.5287/bodleian:AePBKpxV8}}. The results shown in the body of the text make ample reference to this material, and its inspection is encouraged.
